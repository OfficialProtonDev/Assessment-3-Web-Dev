                            NZ has a wealth of critical historical events, including the Treaty of Waitangi, He Whakaputanga, The New Zealand Wars, and several others.
                            Today we are going to be having an in-depth look at 6 of these events, and how they shaped NZ to be the country it is today.

                        <p>
                            In the 1830's, the British were worried that the U.S or France may try to claim NZ as their own. Due to this worry, James Busby, who was appointed as the first British resident of New 
                            Zealand, created a document for chiefs to sign, with the help of two missionaries, William Colenso & Henry Williams, which declared the chiefs as rulers of NZ. The declaration 
                            contained 4 articles, the first declared NZ an independent state, the second stated that sovereign power was held by the chiefs, the third article said that a group / congress would
                            meet in autumn every year to create laws and make other political decisions. The final article stated that a copy would be sent to the king of England asking him to be a parent of this 
                            new state.

                        <h1>The Treaty of Waitangi</h1>
                        <p>
                            The Treaty of Waitangi is a document that was signed on February 6th, 1840, at Waitangi, by representatives of the British Crown and various Māori chiefs. It is widely regarded as NZ's 
                            founding document. The treaty is significant for many reasons, it recognizes and acknowledges the rights of the Māori as the indigenous people of NZ, addresses the land ownership 
                            issue, forms a basis for a legal and political system, and has become an example of partnership between Māori and non-Māori New Zealanders.

                        <h1>The North Taranaki War</h1>
                        <p>
                            The New Zealand Land Wars were a number of battles between some iwi and government forces (including British and colonial troops) and their Maori allies in the mid-19th-century. One of these 
                            battles was in Northern Taranaki, this battle started when a young chief of Waitara offered to sell 600 acres of land to a British governor, however a more senior chief objected, and when the
                            surveying of the purchase was being started, they were interrupted by supporters of this senior chief, so they occupied the area with British troops, and when they saw the senior chief's
                            supporters building fortifications on the ridge above, they attacked them with cannons and rocket fire, and were soon met with retalitory shots from the fortifications. At dawn, however,
                            they discovered that the fortifications had been abandoned.

                        <p>
                            NZ officially became the first self-governing country to give woman the right to vote in parliamentary elections in the September of 1983. This was made official on the 19th of 
                            September when Governor Lord Glasgow signed the Electoral Act into law. In other democracies such as Britian or the U.S, women did not receive the right to vote until after WW1.
                            This was achieved after suffrage campaigners spent years compiling a massive series of petitions demanding women be given the right to vote.

                        <p>
                            Abel Tasman is officially recognized as the first European to discover New Zealand. He set sail in search of a large continent that some Dutch merchants believed existed in the
                            South Pacific, and sighted New Zealand on December 13th, 1642. He did not go ashore hovever, as a violent incursion with some of the local Maori on December 19th scared him away.
                            He sailed along the west coast but did not identify how far east the land extended before he left. Later, a dutch mapmaker named the land "Nieuw Zeeland", which was the origin of the
                            name New Zealand.
