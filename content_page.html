                        <p>
                            New Zealand is home to a bi-cultural society, these cultures are the Māori culture and a
                            unique European/Kiwi culture, and while the Kiwi culture is the more prevalent of the two,
                            the Māori culture is growing larger every year, as various efforts have been put in place to
                            promote it. The I.T industry is no exception to this rule, with attempts being made to increase
                            the Māori culture’s representation in the field. The Treaty of Waitangi is also a key part of
                            NZ’s bicultural society, as it forms the basis of the relationship between Māori and the
                            government.

                        <h1>What is the significance of NZ’s bicultural society?</h1>
                        <p>
                            NZ’s bicultural society has been around since the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840.
                            This unique blend of the Kiwi and Māori cultures has led to a vast impact on many industries
                            around NZ. The tourism industry, for example, has heavily capitalized on the Māori culture,
                            making it a key part of the NZ experience for tourists from all around the world. The
                            education system has also been heavily influenced, with the Māori culture being integrated
                            into most if not all schools in NZ, with classes for Te Reo Māori and even some cultural
                            practices being included in school assemblies.

                        <h1>What is the Treaty of Waitangi?</h1>
                        <p>
                            The Treaty of Waitangi is a document that was signed on February 6th, 1840, between
                            representatives of the British Crown and various Māori chiefs. It is widely regarded as NZ's
                            founding document. The treaty is significant for many reasons, it recognizes and
                            acknowledges the rights of the Māori as the indigenous people of NZ, addresses the land
                            ownership issue, forms a basis for a legal and political system, and has become an example
                            of partnership between Māori and non-Māori New Zealanders.

                        <p>
                            NZ’s bicultural society has had a substantial impact on NZ’s I.T industry, with IT companies
                            finding themselves having to consider representing both cultures in an equal way to ensure
                            their product / service resonates with all New Zealanders. Some websites also need to
                            consider whether they need to offer a Te Reo Māori option. Iwis (Māori tribes) have also
                            leveraged I.T to develop websites to connect their Iwi, preserve their history, and spread
                            their culture. The I.T industry is also working hard to get more Māori to adopt the internet
                            into their lives, as they have been slower at doing so than other ethnicities.
